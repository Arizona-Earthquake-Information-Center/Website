	  A seismogram, the paper recording from a seismograph, showing the P-wave first and the S-wave second. The first waves to arrive, and thus with the highest velocity, were termed primae, Latin for primary or first. These were followed a few minutes later 
      by higher-amplitude waves. This second clear wave type was, of course, termed secundae or secondary.
      The abbreviations P-wave(primary) and S-wave (secondary) later became popular for these waves.</p>

      Rows of crops in the Imperial Valley, California, offset by a fault slip that occurred during the 1979 earthquake. The fault has right lateral movement.</p>

      Sketch diagram of pendulum attachment points. If properly designed, this point of attachment can be virtually friction free when the pendulum is in motion, ideal for a recording earthquakes. Only one simple step remains: to attach a pen or a stylus to the pendulum mass so that it lightly contacts a piece of paper to record the motion of the 
      ground beneath the pendulum. Two design principles make this a workable seismometer. First, the pendulum is largely isolated from the ground movement by its suspension design. Second, the mass of the pendulum has inertia, and tends to remain at rest. These two basic principles were utilized in the design of early seismometers.</b></p>

      <p><img src="images/quiz/building_pend.jpg" alt="Multistory building as pendulum" width="89" height="150" border="0" class="imageleft" />
      Seismometers are not the only inverted pendulums. Multistory buildings can also act as pendulums, fixed at the ground surface. Because pendulum length determines the free period of a pendulum different heights will have different periods 
      of oscillation. The most intense waves to shake the ground during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake had periods of about 2 seconds. This matched the free period of buildings about 10 to 14 stories high. Some of the buildings were unable to withstand the resulting resonant oscillations and collapsed.</p>

      <p><img src="images/quiz/candelabrum.jpg" alt="Pendulum" width="112" height="150" border="0" class="imageleft" />Galileo's (1564-1642) contribution to the understanding of the acceleration due to gravity apparently grew out of observations of pendulums. A story often told is that as a young man he attended Mass
        at a cathedral in Pisa and watched a candelabrum swing to and fro 
        (oscillate) after it was lighted and noted that while the swings became shorter, the time of the swing remained 
        constant.</p>
      <p>Later Galileo checked his observation by tying stones on a string. He found that with strings of
        different length, the result was different times of oscillation (free periods), but for a given string length,
        even with different weights of stones, the pendulum had the same period. 
        Thus, Galileo had discovered that the period of oscillation of a pendulum is directly related to 
        pendulum length, a key component of early seismographs.</p>

      <p>Something beginning Seismologists should have in their tool belts, an easy way to map US earthquake epicenters.; Press Control + N on your key board. Go back to the original window. Go the <a href="eq_history.html">AZ QUAKE History</a> page and copy the latitude and longitude. In the new window go to <a href="http://www.topozone.com/viewmaps.asp">Topo Zone</a>. Paste the coordinates in the Latitude/ Longitude box. Press Map and use the mapping tools on the 
  left side to customize your view.</p>
