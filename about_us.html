  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>History of  the Arizona Earthquake Information Center</h2>
  <p>Earthquake monitoring in northern Arizona can be traced back to 1961 when the first Flagstaff 
    station FS-AZ was established as part of a national program known as Vela 
    Uniform, that was initiated to study the monitoring and detection of 
    underground nuclear tests. Station FS-AZ was active between 1961 and 
    1966 when it was terminated. A second Flagstaff station, FLG, was 
    established in 1966 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as part 
    of a program to develop instrumentation and techniques for the 
    installation of seismometers on the Moon. This effort was concurrent 
    with the Apollo Moon landing programs and the station was discontinued in 
    the summer of 1972.</p>
  <p>The Department of Geology at Northern Arizona University became committed to long term monitoring of 
    seismicity in northern Arizona in 1977. This resulted in the 
    establishment of a third Flagstaff station, FLAG, at a permanent site on 
    the University campus. This was followed by the founding of the 
    northern Arizona Seismic network and the AEIC in 1986, in accordance with 
    formal authorization by the Arizona Board of Regents. The original 
    network consisted of three seismic station at Flagstaff, Williams, and the 
    Grand Canyon. Today the seismic network includes eight stations 
    stretching from the Utah boarder to the southern edge of the Colorado 
    Plateau. Through our node at the University of Utah, Salt Lake 
    City, the northern Arizona network is a participating member of the 
    Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).</p>
  <h2>Purpose of AEIC</h2>
  <p> The purpose of the AEIC is to collect and 
    distribute information on Arizona earthquakes, and to conduct research on 
    them. These tasks all contribute to increased knowledge about why 
    earthquakes occur in our state and what the potential hazards to the 
    populace may be.</p>
  <p>Collection and distribution of earthquake data 
    is handled by two branches of the AEIC, the Seismic Archives and the 
    Sherman Mifflin Smith seismic observatory. The primary task of the 
    seismic archive is to catalogue, store, and distribute information on 
    earthquakes. Records in the archives dating back to 1966 are found 
    nowhere else and provide a valuable data source to scientists and 
    historians. The archives contain 10,000 paper records of 
    earthquakes, as well as microfilm, microfiche, and original seismograph 
    logbooks. </p>
  <p>The <a href="sms_observatory.html">Sherman Mifflin Smith Seismic Observatory</a> is the operation center for the northern Arizona seismic network and 
    monitors and collects data on earthquakes throughout northern and central 
    Arizona.</p>
  <p>The old saying &quot;forewarned is forearmed&quot; sums 
    up the service that the AEIC is providing for the people of Arizona. 
    Because of our sparse population in this state, our broad open spaces, we 
    know less about earthquakes in Arizona than we ought to. The more we 
    do know, through the efforts of the AEIC, the better we will understand 
    where and why earthquakes occur, and how often we may expect damaging 
    tremors. This is important to the safety and wellbeing of the 
    citizens of our state.</p>

  <h2>Do Your Part</h2>
  <p>The Arizona Earthquake 
    Information Center is only partly supported by state funds and so must 
    rely on contributions from other sources to survive. Without these 
    other funds, there would be no Arizona Earthquake Information Center.
